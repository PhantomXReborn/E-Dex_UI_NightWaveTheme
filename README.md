## ✨ Visual Philosophy

Russian Violet emphasizes **contrast without harshness**. Instead of bright neon colors, it uses controlled saturation and subtle glow to reduce eye strain while preserving visual depth.

- Dark environments enhance focus  
- Soft lavender text maintains readability  
- Purple accents add character without distraction  

The result is a theme that feels calm, powerful, and modern.
